# Satellite Image Inpainting based with Edge Enhanced Attention
This repository contains the implementation of the research paper "Satellite Image Inpainting based with Edge Enhanced Attention". The paper is currently under submission.

## Introduction
Satellite image inpainting is an important task in remote sensing and image processing. This project implements a novel inpainting method that leverages edge-enhanced attention mechanisms base on a pure Transformer architecture to improve the quality and accuracy of inpainted satellite images.

## Requirements
Python >=3.6
PyTorch >=1.6
NVIDIA GPU + CUDA cuDNN
